#+TITLE: Certificate Patrol

* Introduction

=libcertpatrol= implements public key pinning for TLS using a trust on first use
(TOFU) model.

It is intended as a fallback mechanism when there's no pinning protocol in use
by the server, such as DANE or TACK.

It is described in more detail in https://gnunet.org/tofu-pinning
